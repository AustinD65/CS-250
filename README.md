•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  o	User stories help with this process by translating the user’s needs into achievable goals. In the user story format, the user’s needs are   clearly defined by input(Needs) and output(Desired outcome). This leaves little room for misinterpretation and creates an actionable item     for the development team. 
  
•	How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  o	The first step is coming up with a plan, a framework of what I would like the program to accomplish in the end and a detailed step by       step of which processes need to be completed in order to achieve that goal. Once the plan is completed it will be time to build, iterate      and refine the program until it is functional. 
  o	The Agile processes that I hope to incorporate into my future development work are retrospectives/review, and sprints. Retrospectives to    set aside time to comb through what I have created and check for opportunities for errors, efficiency, and code clarity. Sprints to give      myself a timeline to complete certain aspects of the project that I am working on. Whether it be solo or in a group I really like the         sprint process of Agile because it promotes efficiency and establishes an end goal. 
  
•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  o	I would say the most important aspect of being a good team member in software development is being reliable. Showing up every day on          time, delivering your portion of the work when it is due, and being available to help out your peers when they need it. Also being a          team player that is open to sharing ideas, listen to others, accept feedback, and understand other people’s perspectives.
